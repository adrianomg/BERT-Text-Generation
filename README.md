# BERT - Text Generation

I created this repository for playing around and trying to understand how to use BERT to generate text.
Be aware that BERT is not a traditional language model but a masked language model. 
It cannot be used to compute the probability of a sentence like a normal LM, so it is not designed to generate text.
Therefore, do not take it too seriously.
